## 📋 What Happens During Build

1. **Metro bundler** generates your JavaScript bundle
2. **Source maps** are automatically created
3. **Sentry plugin** automatically uploads source maps
4. **Build artifacts** are created for distribution

## 🔍 Post-Build Verification

After building, verify in Sentry:
1. Go to [de.sentry.io](https://de.sentry.io/)
2. Check your `react-native` project
3. Look for release `1.0.1` with build `47`
4. Verify source maps are uploaded in Settings → Source Maps

## 🎯 Expected Results

- **Build #47** will be created successfully
- **Source maps** will be automatically uploaded
- **Error tracking** will show readable stack traces
- **No more minified code** in error reports

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If the build fails:
- Check EAS build logs
- Verify `SENTRY_ALLOW_FAILURE=true` in eas.json (already set)
- Ensure your auth token is still valid
