# Sentry Source Maps Setup Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete - Everything is Working!

Your Sentry source maps are now fully configured and tested. Here's what we've accomplished:

✅ **Sentry React Native SDK** - Already installed and configured  
✅ **Sentry CLI** - Already installed (v2.52.0)  
✅ **Metro Configuration** - Already set up for Sentry  
✅ **App Configuration** - Updated to enable source maps  
✅ **Build Scripts** - Added to package.json  
✅ **Configuration Files** - Created and configured correctly  
✅ **German Sentry Instance** - Correctly configured for de.sentry.io  
✅ **Authentication** - Working correctly  
✅ **Source Map Upload** - Tested and verified  

## 🎯 Your Working Configuration

- **DSN**: `https://8098766737acb190f51b8ecf8f349cb3@o4509841318608896.ingest.de.sentry.io/4509841326211152`
- **Organization ID**: `4509841318608896` (without the 'o' prefix)
- **Project ID**: `4509841326211152`
- **Project Slug**: `react-native`
- **Instance**: German (de.sentry.io)
- **Auth Token**: ✅ Working

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Build Your App (Source Maps Will Auto-Upload)

```bash
# Build for production (source maps will be automatically generated and uploaded)
npm run build:android
# or
npm run build:ios
# or
npm run build:both
```

### 2. Verify Source Maps in Sentry

1. Go to [de.sentry.io](https://de.sentry.io/)
2. Navigate to your project: `react-native`
3. Go to Settings → Source Maps
4. You should see uploaded source maps for your releases

### 3. Test Error Tracking

When errors occur in your app, Sentry will now show readable stack traces instead of minified code!

## 🔧 How Source Maps Work Now

1. **Automatic Generation**: Metro generates source maps during build
2. **Automatic Upload**: Sentry automatically uploads them to your project
3. **Symbolication**: Errors show readable source code instead of minified code

## 📁 Configuration Files Summary

- **app.json**: ✅ Updated with correct org ID and source maps enabled
- **sentry.properties**: ✅ Configured for German instance
- **sentry.env.example**: ✅ Template for environment variables
- **metro.config.js**: ✅ Already configured for Sentry
- **test-sentry.js**: ✅ Test script to verify configuration

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

If you want to test the configuration again:

```bash
# Set your auth token
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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

# Run the test
node test-sentry.js
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your Sentry source maps are now fully configured and will automatically work when you build your app. No more minified stack traces - you'll get clear, readable error information that makes debugging much easier!
